\section{Abstract}

Icosahedral viruses have the symmetries of an icosahedron, which involves 2-fold, 3-fold, and 5-fold rotational symmetries.
We can approximate these virus capsids with finite sets of points (called a point array) which we realize in 6D (not just 3D) for the purpose of crystallography: our 6D point arrays naturally fit inside 6D icosahedral lattices. There are \(55\) standard point arrays (called \emph{one-base}) from which we build all the others.
We model virus maturation by 6D linear transformations (transitions) of point arrays that preserve some or all of icosahedral symmetry.
The symmetries we wish to preserve are either full icosahedral, $A_4$ ($3$-fold and $2$-fold), $D_{10}$ ($5$-fold and $2$-fold) or $D_6$ ($3$-fold and $2$-fold) symmetry.
We define full icosahedral symmetry as a group defined by \(\mathcal{I} := \generatedby{a, b | a^2 = b^3 = (ab)^5 = 1}\).
We then notice that \(A_4, D_{10}, \text{ and } D_6\) are maximal subgroups of \(\mathcal{I}\).
To find transitions that preserve one of these symmetry groups, we solve matrix equations of the form \(TB_0 = B_1\) for \(T\), where \(T\) is a \(6\times6\) matrix that depends on either 2, 4, 6, or 8 real variables, depending on which symmetry we are looking at and \(B_0\) and \(B_1\) are representations of the point arrays.
Note that actually finding transitions requires a large amount of computation.
From this we are able to reproduce previously discovered transitions for the Cowpea Chlorotic Mottle Virus that preserve \(D_6\) symmetry, and more importantly create a comprehesive list of what symmetries can be preserved between any possible combination of the \(55\) standard point arrays.

\section{Intro}
Icosahedral viruses have the symmetries of an icosahedron, which involves 2-fold, 3-fold, and 5-fold rotational symmetries.
We can approximate these virus capsids with finite sets of points (called a point array) which we realize in 6D (not just 3D) for the purpose of crystallography: our 6D point arrays naturally fit inside 6D icosahedral lattices. 
There are \(55\) standard point arrays (called \emph{one-base}) from which we build all the others.
We model virus maturation by 6D linear transformations (transitions) of point arrays that preserve some or all of icosahedral symmetry.


% Viruses have a point cloud, we can then lift into 6D dimensions in a non-trivial way.
% These point clouds will then fit into a \emph{lattice}.

Relevant to our work the shape of the icosahedron, a shape with 2-fold, 3-fold, and 5-fold symmetry.
\begin{Definition}[Icosahedral Group]
	The icosahedral group, which we denote by \(\mathcal{I}\), is the 60-element group given by \[\mathcal{I} := \generatedby{a, b | a^2 = b^3 = (ab)^5 = 1}.\]
\end{Definition}
\noindent We realize the icosahedral group as a \( 6 \times 6 \) matrix group.
\begin{Definition}[Generators of the Icosahedral Group]
	A 6D representation of the generators for \(\mathcal{I}\) are as follows:
	\[a = \begin{bmatrix}
		-1 & 0  & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
		0  & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
		0  & 0  & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
		0  & 0  & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
		0  & 0  & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
		0  & 0  & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0
	\end{bmatrix} \quad b = \begin{bmatrix}
		0 & -1 & 0  & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
		0 & 0  & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
		1 & 0  & 0  & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
		0 & 0  & 0  & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
		0 & 0  & 0  & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
		0 & 0  & 0  & 0 & 1 & 0
	\end{bmatrix}.\]
\end{Definition}

\section{Results}
After doing these computational methods, I found intriguing results, summarized by the following:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item These methods produce the same four \( D_6 \) transition matrices for CCMV given in \cite{indelicatoetal2012}.
	
	\item These methods allow us to find all symmetry preserving transitions exist between all of the 55 standard one-base point arrays. Larger point arrays must be built from these 55, so this data also helps in determining what transitions are and are not possible between bigger point arrays.
	
	\item There cannot exist any transition that preserves all of icosahedral symmetry between any different point arrays, since no such icosahedral symmetry preserving transition exists between any of the 55 standard point arrays.
		We can only find transitions that preserve the maximal subgroups \(D_6, D_{10}, \text{ and } A_4\).
	
	\item \todo[inline]{Talk about 2+ base results; comprehensive 2 base running on Jigwe currently}
\end{enumerate}
