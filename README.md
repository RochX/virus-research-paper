# virus-research-paper
This repository is for the TeX files and PDFs that go along with my research paper on icosahedral virus transitions.
The paper is part of my Senior Integrated Project (SIP) at Kalamazoo College.

The code and programs referenced in the papers can be found at my other repositories:

## one_base_table.csv
The file `one_base_table.csv` is a CSV file that contains whether or not a symmetry preserving transition exists for each of the possible one-base to one-base transitions.
See the paper for more details.
